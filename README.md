CSCI 246: Discrete Structures

## Course schedule
The schedule is subject to change.


## Description
- 3 credits
- Prerequisites: M 171Q or M 165Q
- COREQUISITE: CSCI 132

This course covers logic, discrete probability, recurrence relations, boolean algebra, sets, relations, counting, functions, maps, Big-O notation, proof techniques including induction, and proof by contradiction.

## Course information
This course meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 4:10 p.m.–5 p.m. in Reid 105. Course meetings consist of a combination of lectures, in-class activities, and quizzes. We will use Discord as the primary method of communication, and course information will be posted on d2l and github.

## Course outcomes
By following lectures, completing assignments and quizzes, and reading the textbook, students should:

	- be able to read and use mathematical terminology around sets, functions, propositions, predicate logic, asymptotic notation, recursion, and graphs.
	
	- be able to read and write mathematical proofs using the following methods:
		* Direct proofs
		* Proofs by counterexample
		* Proof by construction
		* Proofs by contradiction
		* Proofs by contrapositive
		* Proofs by induction
	- improve their problem-solving skills and critical thinking skills.
		* using examples, counter-examples, diagrams, simpler cases, similar problems, etc., to better understand a mathematical statement
		* recognizing a broken proof or a false start and using it to find a new result or approach,
		
  	- thinking critically about which proof paradigm is most appropriate.
