## Description
- 3 credits
- Prerequisites: M 171Q or M 165Q
- COREQUISITE: CSCI 132

This course covers logic, discrete probability, recurrence relations, boolean algebra, sets, relations, counting, functions, maps, Big-O notation, proof techniques including induction, and proof by contradiction.

## Course information
This course meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 4:10 p.m.–5 p.m. in Reid 105. Course meetings consist of a combination of lectures, in-class activities, and quizzes. We will use Discord as the primary method of communication, and course information will be posted on d2l and github.

## Course resources

Textbook
* Connecting Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science by David Liben-Nowell. A free PDF version is available here: https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dln/book/ . You can buy the physical book if you like to do so. 

## Course Assistants
- Name: TBA

## Instructor Office hours
- Tuesday - 10:00AM-12:00PM
- Friday - 11:00-12:00PM
- Barnard 349

## Grading
You will be graded on the following:

- 11 homework assignments (lowest score homework will be dropped out of 12 homeworks -- 11 homeworks will be used towards the final grade): 50%
- 3 tests: in class (including final): 40%
- In-class assignments (1 point for participating in each one, for up to 10 points total; there will be more than 10): 10%

## Computer Science Success Center
- There are free tutors availble in Barnard 259. https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html

Discord Server: All communication will be done via our course Discord Server. Please pay attention to messages in discord server. Please [change your nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20the,new%20nickname%20of%20your%20choice!) to your full name (first and last). Additionally, I suggest managing your notification settings. Check out [Discord’s Notification Settings 101 page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101) to get started. You may also need to manage the application notification settings on your device.

## Course outcomes
By following lectures, completing assignments and quizzes, and reading the textbook, students should:

- be able to read and use mathematical terminology around sets, functions, propositions, predicate logic, asymptotic notation, recursion, and graphs.

- be able to read and write mathematical proofs using the following methods:
	* Direct proofs
	* Proofs by counterexample
	* Proof by construction
	* Proofs by contradiction
	* Proofs by contrapositive
	* Proofs by induction
- improve their problem-solving skills and critical thinking skills.
	* using examples, counter-examples, diagrams, simpler cases, similar problems, etc., to better understand a mathematical statement
	* recognizing a broken proof or a false start and using it to find a new result or approach,
	
- thinking critically about which proof paradigm is most appropriate.

## Accommodations
If you have a documented disability and need or might need accommodations, please reach out the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible and then talk to me.

## Collaboration policy
- For your homework assignments, you may discuss the problem with your peers.
- However, you are not allowed to copy proofs from your peers, use generative AI to complete your assignments.
- You MUST not post the solutions of the homeworks on the internet.
